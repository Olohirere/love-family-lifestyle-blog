                    <h2>Parenting, A blessing or a curse?</h2>
                  </div>
                  <p>Last week, I had a meeting with a group of people and we talked on parenting. Some parents complained about their kids and some others shared their good and not so good experiences on
                      how they raised their kids. The discussion was from the Biblical story of the priest called 'Eli' and his sons.
                    Eli who was a Priest had two sons who misbahaved and offended God is so many ways. 
                As we discussed further, a lady in our midst couldn't help but share her experiences on how it's been so difficult raising her eldest son. She complained bitterly and asked for contributions and she also asked if Parenting is a Blessing or a Curse. A lot of persons encouraged her and I also did. <br><br>
                Dear Parents, raising Kids is not <em>BEANS!</em>. You cannot do it on you own. You need God to help you. 
                First, Parenting is a Blessing and Never a curse. Yes, Children will sometimes look like a torn in your flesh but they are priceless gifts from God. 
                One way to handle them is to raise them up in the way of the Lord. When you do this, you have nothing to FEAR.

                    <h2>Yelling at Kids, good or bad?</h2>
                  </div>
                  <p>If you’ve ever been yelled at, you know that a loud voice does not make the message clearer. Your children are no different. Shouting will make them tune out and discipline will be harder, since each time you raise your voice lowers their receptivity.

                    Recent researchTrusted Source points out that yelling makes children more aggressive, physically and verbally. Yelling in general, no matter what the context, is an expression of anger. It scares children and makes them feel insecure.
                    
                    Calmness, on the other hand, is reassuring, which makes children feel loved and accepted in spite of bad behavior.<br><br>
                    
                    If yelling at children is not a good thing, yelling that comes with verbal putdowns and insults can be qualified as emotional abuse. It’s been shown to have long-term effects, like anxiety, low self-esteem, and increased aggression.
                    
                    It also makes children more susceptible to bullying since their understanding of healthy boundaries and self-respect are skewed.<blockquote><strong>Source:</strong>https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/yelling-at-kids#get-help</blockquote>

                  <p>He asked me what I was gonna do If he tells me he loves me and I almost fainted. lol. I told him I'd be very happy. He was excited too so he asked me out over the phone. 
                    I couldn't believe I was in a relationship till he said "Baby". It felt like a dream and I didn't want to wake up. lol<br><br>I remember my Mum saying "bring your guy home oh even if you want to read all the books in this life". This statement came bacause I told her I was gonna get my doctorate's
                    before starting any relationship. Well, I wasn't though because I just ended a 3years relationship and needed some space. I was bothered about the person I'd get married to and I decided to get busy with myself and God and soon, I believed he will show up. <br><br> Yes, he did show up and when he came, he swept me off my feet.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LagosConvo/posts/1397650930339836">continue reading..</a> Eureka!

                  <p>I wrote an assessment for a top company in the UK and everyday I refreshed my mail hoping to get a mail from them. Yesterday the mail came in and I wasn't taken. I felt really sad because I know I did well at the assessment but instead of letting it weigh me down, I braced myself up. 
                      <br> Dear Friends, Some days may be so tough that you'd almost start doubting if you are good enough. Some other days, you may wonder if God has forsaken you. <br><br>
                    My dear, God will always show up for you. Instead of worrying about your not-so-good days, Brace yourself up, enhance resilience, keep pushing and soon, everything will be a thing of the past. <br>
                In my not so-good moments, my family and friends came through for me and then I realized again that <em><strong>family is Everything!!</strong></em><br><br>If you enjoyed reading, please like and hit the <em><strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong></em> button to get more personalized contents. </p>
